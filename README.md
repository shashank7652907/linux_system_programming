This repository is a hands-on learning workspace for Linux system programming concepts.

The focus is on understanding how processes, threads, IPC mechanisms, and synchronization primitives work internally by building programs from scratch, experimenting, and learning through iteration — not by copying ready-made code.

This repository will be updated continuously as new concepts and real-world scenarios are explored.
